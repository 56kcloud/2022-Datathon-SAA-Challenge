           For customers purchasing a new travel protection plan, some of our plans now include an Epidemic Coverage Endorsement, which adds epidemic-related covered reasons for certain benefits. Benefits vary by plan and by state of residence, and are not available in all jurisdictions.

          <p>
           Please read your plan documents to see if the
           <strong>
            Epidemic Coverage Endorsement
           </strong>
           is included in your plan. We are also offering certain temporary accommodations as described

             I am worried about COVID-19 impacting a trip I have scheduled or plan to schedule. Should I buy an Allianz travel protection plan to cover me in case COVID-19 impacts my trip?

           </li>
           <li class="ans hiddenElement question1">
            <p>
             COVID-19 is a known and evolving epidemic that is impacting travel worldwide, with continued spread and impacts expected.  Our travel protection plans do not generally cover losses directly or indirectly related to known, foreseeable, or expected events, epidemics, government prohibitions, warnings, or travel advisories, or fear of travel.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, we are pleased to announce the introduction of our Epidemic Coverage Endorsement to certain plans purchased on or after March 6, 2021.  This endorsement adds certain new covered reasons related to epidemics (including COVID-19) to some of our most popular insurance plans.  Please see the below FAQ section on “Epidemic Coverage Endorsement” for more information.  Note, the Epidemic Coverage Endorsement may not be available for all plans or in all jurisdictions.  To see if your plan includes this endorsement, please look for “Epidemic Coverage Endorsement” on your Declarations of Coverage or Letter of Confirmation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Additionally, in response to the ongoing public health and travel crisis, we are temporarily extending certain claims accommodations as follows*:
            </p>
            <p>
             1. For plans that do not include the Epidemic Coverage Endorsement, we are temporarily accommodating claims for the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Emergency medical care for an insured who becomes ill with COVID-19 while on their trip
              <em>
               (if your plan includes the Emergency Medical Care benefit)
              </em>
             </li>
             <li>
              Trip cancellation and trip interruption if an insured, or that insured’s traveling companion or family member, becomes ill with COVID-19 either before or during the insured’s trip
              <em>
               (if your plan includes Trip Cancellation or Trip Interruption benefits, as applicable)
              </em>
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             2. If an insured or their traveling companion become ill with COVID-19 while on their trip, that insured will not be subject to the Trip Interruption benefit’s five-day maximum limit for additional accommodation and transportation expenses (however, the maximum daily limit for such expenses and the maximum Trip Interruption benefit limit still apply).
            </p>
            <p>
             These temporary accommodations are strictly applicable to COVID-19 and are only available to customers whose plan includes the applicable benefit.  These accommodations apply to plans currently in effect but may not apply to plans purchased in the future, so please refer to our

             No, canceling a trip because you’re afraid to travel due to COVID-19 is generally not covered by our travel protection plans.

             Claims due to known, foreseeable, or expected events, epidemics, government prohibitions, warnings, or travel advisories or fear of travel are generally not covered.  As such, our travel insurance plans do not generally cover trip cancellations or interruptions directly or indirectly related to COVID-19.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, we are pleased to announce the introduction of our Epidemic Coverage Endorsement to certain plans purchased on or after March 6, 2021.  This endorsement adds certain new covered reasons related to epidemics (including COVID-19) to some of our most popular insurance plans. Please see the below FAQ section on “Epidemic Coverage Endorsement” for more information.  Note, the Epidemic Coverage Endorsement may not be available for all plans or in all jurisdictions.  To see if your plan includes this endorsement, please look for “Epidemic Coverage Endorsement” on your Declarations of Coverage or Letter of Confirmation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Additionally, in response to the ongoing public health and travel crisis, we are temporarily extending certain claims accommodations as follows*:
            </p>
            <p>
             1. For plans that do not include the Epidemic Coverage Endorsement, we are temporarily accommodating claims for the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Emergency medical care for an insured who becomes ill with COVID-19 while on their trip
              <em>
               (if your plan includes the Emergency Medical Care benefit)
              </em>
             </li>
             <li>
              Trip cancellation and trip interruption if an insured, or that insured’s traveling companion or family member, becomes ill with COVID-19 either before or during the insured’s trip
              <em>
               (if your plan includes Trip Cancellation or Trip Interruption benefits, as applicable)
              </em>
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             2. If an insured or their traveling companion become ill with COVID-19 while on their trip, that insured will not be subject to the Trip Interruption benefit’s five-day maximum limit for additional accommodation and transportation expenses (however, the maximum daily limit for such expenses and the maximum Trip Interruption benefit limit still apply).

              You generally have 15 days (or more, depending on your plan and state of residence) from the date your plan was purchased to request a refund of the cost of your plan, provided you have not started your trip or initiated a claim.

              Additionally, for a temporary period, we are offering refunds for the cost of your single-trip travel protection plan if your travel supplier cancels your trip due to COVID-19, as long as no payable claim has been filed under the plan. (This is not available for annual travel insurance plans, which may be canceled any time for a refund of unearned premium.) Refunds must be requested within 770 days of the original plan purchase date.*

             Yes, you may change your travel protection plan’s effective dates to cover a new or rescheduled trip, as long as that trip is scheduled to be completed within 770 days from the plan’s original purchase date.  Changes can be made at

            <p>
             Please note, if you wish to move your plan’s covered trip dates to cover a new or rescheduled trip, you must update your trip dates prior to the departure date of that new or rescheduled trip and prior to any loss for which you seek coverage.*  Additionally, if your trip costs for your new or rescheduled trip are different than the cost of your original trip, you will need to update your plan’s coverage limits accordingly.  Any change in trip cost insured for the new or rescheduled trip may result in a change in premium.  If you update your plan’s trip dates to cover a new or rescheduled trip but do not adjust your limits, the original plan limits will apply to the new or rescheduled trip.

             Our Cancel Anytime plans provide up to 100% reimbursement of non-refundable, pre-paid trip costs when a trip is canceled for a covered reason, and up to 80% of those costs for most other unforeseen reasons for cancellation. However, our plans do not provide “Cancel For Any Reason” coverage, and coverage under these plans is subject to terms, conditions, and exclusions. Specifically, Cancel Anytime plans generally exclude coverage for losses directly or indirectly resulting from any of the following: known, foreseeable, or expected events, epidemics, and government prohibitions, and certain other causes of loss. As such, losses directly or indirectly resulting from COVID-19 are not generally covered under our Cancel Anytime plans.

If an insured or their traveling companion become ill with COVID-19 while on their trip, that insured will not be subject to the Trip Interruption benefit’s five-day maximum limit for additional accommodation and transportation expenses (however, the maximum daily limit for such expenses and the maximum Trip Interruption benefit limit still apply).

             Our plans generally define a pre-existing medical condition as an injury, illness, or medical condition that, within the 120 days prior to and including the purchase date of your travel protection plan:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              Caused a person to seek medical examination, diagnosis, care, or treatment by a doctor;

             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             The illness, injury, or medical condition does not need to be formally diagnosed in order to be considered a pre-existing medical condition.
            </p>
            <p>
             If your medical documentation indicates that COVID-19 symptoms/treatment were present within the 120 day look-back period prior to your insurance purchase, the condition could fall under the definition of a pre-existing medical condition.

             Please note:  Many plans include a Pre-Existing Medical Condition Exclusion Waiver. If your travel insurance plan includes this Waiver, and you meet the conditions of the Waiver, then this exclusion will not apply to your plan.  One of the conditions to qualify for this Waiver is that you must be medically able to travel on the day you purchased your plan.  As such, if you are not medically able to travel on the day you purchase your plan as a result of “long-haul” or an ongoing or active case of COVID-19, you may not be eligible for this Waiver.

             What is meant by “individually ordered” quarantine?

           <li class="ans hiddenElement question19">
            <p>
             A quarantine is considered “individually ordered” when these conditions, as specified in the plan, are met:
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">
             i. The quarantine is specific to you or a traveling companion, meaning that you or a traveling companion must be specifically and individually designated by name in an order or directive to be placed in quarantine due to an epidemic; and
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">
             ii. The quarantine does not apply generally or broadly (a) to some segment or all of a population, geographical area, building, or vessel (including without limitation shelter-in-place, stay-at-home, safer-at-home, or other similar restriction), or (b) based on to, from, or through where the person is traveling. This condition (ii) applies even if the quarantine order or directive specifically designates you or a traveling companion by name to be quarantined.
            </p>
            <p>
             <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
              Example 1
             </span>
             : While you are on a cruise, the crew of your cruise ship is checking temperatures of all passengers and you or your traveling companion demonstrate a temperature outside the accepted range, causing you both to be ordered to quarantine while on board. This would qualify as an individually-ordered quarantine.
            </p>
            <p>
             <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
              Example 2
             </span>
             : While you are on a cruise, the crew of your cruise ship is checking temperatures of all passengers. As a result of a passenger (not part of your traveling party) demonstrating a temperature outside the accepted range, all passengers on the ship are ordered to quarantine while on board. Because this quarantine applies generally or broadly to the population of the entire vessel, this would not qualify as an individually-ordered quarantine.
            </p>
            <p>
             <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
              Example 3
             </span>
             : While you are on a cruise, the crew of your cruise ship is conducting random COVID-19 testing of passengers.  A passenger who is not part of your traveling party but with whom you have had close contact tests positive for COVID-19.  As a result, you or your traveling companion are ordered to quarantine while on board.  Other passengers who are not close contacts of the ill passenger are allowed to continue freely moving about the ship as normal.  This would qualify as an individually-ordered quarantine.
            </p>
            <p>
             <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
              Example 4
             </span>
             : You fly to a country that requires all persons entering the country to quarantine for fourteen days prior to being permitted to freely travel in the country.  Because this is a general/broad quarantine that applies based on the country to which you are traveling, this would not qualify as an individually-ordered quarantine.

             If you or a traveling companion later become ill with COVID-19 while on your trip, in addition to the Trip Interruption, you may also be eligible for other benefits as well, such as Emergency Medical Care and Emergency Transportation benefits.

Please note, plan refund rules vary by state and plan purchased, so please see your plan for details. • Additionally, for a temporary period, we are offering refunds for the cost of your single-trip travel protection plan if your travel supplier cancels your trip due to COVID-19, as long as no payable claim has been filed under the plan. (This is not available for annual travel insurance plans, which may be canceled any time for a refund of unearned premium.) Refunds must be requested within 770 days of the original plan purchase date.* To cancel your plan for one of these situations, please call us at the number listed on your plan.

However, our plans do not provide “Cancel For Any Reason” coverage, and coverage under these plans is subject to terms, conditions, and exclusions. Specifically, Cancel Anytime plans generally exclude coverage for losses directly or indirectly resulting from any of the following: known, foreseeable, or expected events, epidemics, and government prohibitions, and certain other causes of loss. As such, losses directly or indirectly resulting from COVID-19 are not generally covered under our Cancel Anytime plans. However, we are pleased to announce the introduction of our Epidemic Coverage Endorsement to certain plans purchased on or after March 6, 2021. This endorsement adds certain new covered reasons related to epidemics (including COVID-19) to some of our most popular insurance plans. Please see the below FAQ section on “Epidemic Coverage Endorsement” for more information. Note, the Epidemic Coverage Endorsement may not be available for all plans or in all jurisdictions. To see if your plan includes this endorsement, please look for “Epidemic Coverage Endorsement” on your Declarations of Coverage or Letter of Confirmation. Additionally, in response to the ongoing public health and travel crisis, we are temporarily extending certain claims accommodations as follows*: 1. For plans that do not include the Epidemic Coverage Endorsement, we are temporarily accommodating claims for the following: • Emergency medical care for an insured who becomes ill with COVID-19 while on their trip (if your plan includes the Emergency Medical Care benefit) • Trip cancellation and trip interruption if an insured, or that insured’s traveling companion or family member, becomes ill with COVID-19 either before or during the insured’s trip (if your plan includes Trip Cancellation or Trip Interruption benefits, as applicable) 2. If an insured or their traveling companion become ill with COVID-19 while on their trip, that insured will not be subject to the Trip Interruption benefit’s five-day maximum limit for additional accommodation and transportation expenses (however, the maximum daily limit for such expenses and the maximum Trip Interruption benefit limit still apply). These temporary accommodations are strictly applicable to COVID-19 and are only available to customers whose plan includes the applicable benefit. These accommodations apply to plans currently in effect but may not apply to plans purchased in the future, so please refer to our Coverage Alert for the most up to date information before purchasing." } },{ "@type": "Question", "name": "What are your temporary accommodations for COVID-19?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "To learn more about the temporary, specific accommodations we are currently offering, please read our Coverage Alert. These accommodations apply to plans currently in effect but may not apply to plans purchased in the future, so please refer to our Coverage Alert for the most up to date information before purchasing." } },{ "@type": "Question", "name": "Is a “long-haul” or an ongoing or active case of COVID-19 considered a pre-existing medical condition?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Our plans generally define a pre-existing medical condition as an injury, illness, or medical condition that, within the 120 days prior to and including the purchase date of your travel protection plan: 1. Caused a person to seek medical examination, diagnosis, care, or treatment by a doctor; 2. Presented symptoms; or 3. Required a person to take medication prescribed by a doctor (unless the condition or symptoms are controlled by that prescription, and the prescription has not changed). The illness, injury, or medical condition does not need to be formally diagnosed in order to be considered a pre-existing medical condition. If your medical documentation indicates that COVID-19 symptoms/treatment were present within the 120 day look-back period prior to your insurance purchase, the condition could fall under the definition of a pre-existing medical condition. Please note: Many plans include a Pre-Existing Medical Condition Exclusion Waiver. If your travel insurance plan includes this Waiver, and you meet the conditions of the Waiver, then this exclusion will not apply to your plan. One of the conditions to qualify for this Waiver is that you must be medically able to travel on the day you purchased your plan. As such, if you are not medically able to travel on the day you purchase your plan as a result of “long-haul” or an ongoing or active case of COVID-19, you may not be eligible for this Waiver. Please see your plan documents for details, and learn more about pre-existing medical conditions here." } },{ "@type": "Question", "name": "What is meant by “individually ordered” quarantine?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "A quarantine is considered “individually ordered” when these conditions, as specified in the plan, are met: i. The quarantine is specific to you or a traveling companion, meaning that you or a traveling companion must be specifically and individually designated by name in an order or directive to be placed in quarantine due to an epidemic; and ii. The quarantine does not apply generally or broadly (a) to some segment or all of a population, geographical area, building, or vessel (including without limitation shelter-in-place, stay-at-home, safer-at-home, or other similar restriction), or (b) based on to, from, or through where the person is traveling. This condition (ii) applies even if the quarantine order or directive specifically designates you or a traveling companion by name to be quarantined. Example 1: While you are on a cruise, the crew of your cruise ship is checking temperatures of all passengers and you or your traveling companion demonstrate a temperature outside the accepted range, causing you both to be ordered to quarantine while on board. This would qualify as an individually-ordered quarantine. Example 2: While you are on a cruise, the crew of your cruise ship is checking temperatures of all passengers. As a result of a passenger (not part of your traveling party) demonstrating a temperature outside the accepted range, all passengers on the ship are ordered to quarantine while on board. Because this quarantine applies generally or broadly to the population of the entire vessel, this would not qualify as an individually-ordered quarantine. Example 3: While you are on a cruise, the crew of your cruise ship is conducting random COVID-19 testing of passengers. A passenger who is not part of your traveling party but with whom you have had close contact tests positive for COVID-19. As a result, you or your traveling companion are ordered to quarantine while on board. Other passengers who are not close contacts of the ill passenger are allowed to continue freely moving about the ship as normal. This would qualify as an individually-ordered quarantine. Example 4: You fly to a country that requires all persons entering the country to quarantine for fourteen days prior to being permitted to freely travel in the country. Because this is a general/broad quarantine that applies based on the country to which you are traveling, this would not qualify as an individually-ordered quarantine.
