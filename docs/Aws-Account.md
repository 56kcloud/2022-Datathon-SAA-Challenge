# AWS Account

## Create an AWS Account
To work on the challenge, each team needs to have **one** AWS Account. You can
sign up for a new account [here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

## Create IAM Users
With the email address, you get access to the root user of the account. This
user has the highest priviledges in the account, and should only be used for
management tasks. All of the daily tasks and especially for this challenge
IAM User should be used (if not specified otherwise).

To create IAM users go to the [Identity and Access Management
(IAM)](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2) service. On the users
page, you can create new IAM user. You need to create one user for each of your
teammates and also one user for you.

On the first page, you need to specify the following information:
* User name
* For **Select AWS credential type** select both
  * Access key - Programmatic access

    Used to access
  * Password - AWS Management Console access

    Used to login to the AWS Web UI, also called Management Console
* **Console password:** Autogenerated password
* **Require password reset:** âœ… User must create a new password at next sign-in

On the **Permissions** page, you select **Attach existing policies directly**
and tick the box infront of **AdministratorAccess**. This gives all of you and
your teammates access to all the services.

For this challenge, you don't need to create any tags. After double checking
that all the information is correct, you can then proceed to create the user and
distributed the credentials to your teammate.
