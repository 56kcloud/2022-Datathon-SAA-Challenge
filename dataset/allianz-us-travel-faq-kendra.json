      "Question": "Is a \u201clong-haul\u201d or an ongoing or active case of COVID-19 considered a pre-existing medical condition?",
      "Answer": "Our plans generally define a pre-existing medical condition as an injury, illness, or medical condition that, within the 120 days prior to and including the purchase date of your travel protection plan:  Caused a person to seek medical examination, diagnosis, care, or treatment by a doctor; Presented symptoms; or Required a person to take medication prescribed by a doctor (unless the condition or symptoms are controlled by that prescription, and the prescription has not changed).  The illness, injury, or medical condition does not need to be formally diagnosed in order to be considered a pre-existing medical condition. If your medical documentation indicates that COVID-19 symptoms/treatment were present within the 120 day look-back period prior to your insurance purchase, the condition could fall under the definition of a pre-existing medical condition. Please note:\u00a0 Many plans include a Pre-Existing Medical Condition Exclusion Waiver. If your travel insurance plan includes this Waiver, and you meet the conditions of the Waiver, then this exclusion will not apply to your plan.\u00a0 One of the conditions to qualify for this Waiver is that you must be medically able to travel on the day you purchased your plan.\u00a0 As such, if you are not medically able to travel on the day you purchase your plan as a result of \u201clong-haul\u201d or an ongoing or active case of COVID-19, you may not be eligible for this Waiver. Please see your plan documents for details, and learn more about pre-existing medical conditions here."

      "Question": "If I was exposed to someone with COVID-19, would Trip Cancellation benefits apply?",
      "Answer": "Exposure to someone with COVID-19 is not by itself a covered reason under the Trip Cancellation benefit. However, the Trip Cancellation benefit would apply if you or a traveling companion test positive for COVID-19 or you are diagnosed with COVID-19 by your physician.\u00a0 The Trip Cancellation benefit would also apply if you or your traveling companion are individually-ordered to quarantine as a result of your exposure.

      "Question": "What happens when a traveling companion or I become ill with an epidemic disease such as COVID-19 or is ordered to quarantine?",
      "Answer": "If you or a traveling companion become ill due to an epidemic disease (such as COVID-19) or are individually-ordered to quarantine, these are covered reasons that could trigger Trip Cancellation or Trip interruption benefits for the insured.\u00a0 Note, the plan only covers expenses of the insured. Expenses of traveling companions are not covered unless they are also an insured under the plan.\u00a0 Benefits may not cover the full cost of your quarantine and are subject to applicable benefit limits.\u00a0 For information on what qualifies as an \u201cindividually-ordered quarantine,\u201d see the FAQ\u00a0below on what is meant by individually-ordered quarantine.\u00a0 Please note, this answer is specific to products that include the Epidemic Coverage Endorsement and applicable benefit(s) and covered reason(s) described.

    {
      "Question": "What is meant by \u201cindividually ordered\u201d quarantine?",
      "Answer": "A quarantine is considered \u201cindividually ordered\u201d when these conditions, as specified in the plan, are met: i. The quarantine is specific to you or a traveling companion, meaning that you or a traveling companion must be specifically and individually designated by name in an order or directive to be placed in quarantine due to an epidemic; and ii. The quarantine does not apply generally or broadly (a) to some segment or all of a population, geographical area, building, or vessel (including without limitation shelter-in-place, stay-at-home, safer-at-home, or other similar restriction), or (b) based on to, from, or through where the person is traveling. This condition (ii) applies even if the quarantine order or directive specifically designates you or a traveling companion by name to be quarantined. Example 1: While you are on a cruise, the crew of your cruise ship is checking temperatures of all passengers and you or your traveling companion demonstrate a temperature outside the accepted range, causing you both to be ordered to quarantine while on board. This would qualify as an individually-ordered quarantine. Example 2: While you are on a cruise, the crew of your cruise ship is checking temperatures of all passengers. As a result of a passenger (not part of your traveling party) demonstrating a temperature outside the accepted range, all passengers on the ship are ordered to quarantine while on board. Because this quarantine applies generally or broadly to the population of the entire vessel, this would not qualify as an individually-ordered quarantine. Example 3: While you are on a cruise, the crew of your cruise ship is conducting random COVID-19 testing of passengers.\u00a0 A passenger who is not part of your traveling party but with whom you have had close contact tests positive for COVID-19.\u00a0 As a result, you or your traveling companion are ordered to quarantine while on board.\u00a0 Other passengers who are not close contacts of the ill passenger are allowed to continue freely moving about the ship as normal.\u00a0 This would qualify as an individually-ordered quarantine. Example 4: You fly to a country that requires all persons entering the country to quarantine for fourteen days prior to being permitted to freely travel in the country.\u00a0 Because this is a general/broad quarantine that applies based on the country to which you are traveling, this would not qualify as an individually-ordered quarantine. Please note, this answer is specific to products that include the Epidemic Coverage Endorsement and applicable benefit(s) and covered reason(s) described.

      "Question": "If I\u2019m denied boarding due to suspicion of being ill with COVID-19, would travel delay benefits apply?",
      "Answer": "If you or a traveling companion is denied boarding due to suspicion of COVID-19 illness, and your plan includes the denied boarding covered reason under Trip Interruption or Travel Delay, you may be eligible for coverage under that benefit. The specific expenses that may be covered depends on the benefit and may vary by plan.\u00a0 Please note, this does not include being denied boarding as a result of your refusal or failure to comply with rules or requirements of entry to your destination. Example 1: The crew of your cruise ship is checking temperatures of all passengers prior to allowing them to reboard following a shore excursion.\u00a0 You or your traveling companion demonstrate a temperature outside the accepted range, causing you both to be denied boarding.\u00a0 This may qualify for coverage under the denied boarding covered reason. Example 2: During the process of reboarding a cruise ship after a shore excursion, you are required to fill out a form indicating whether you have attended any gatherings of 50 or more people while off the ship, which the cruise ship has indicated is prohibited for cruise ship passengers.\u00a0 However, you did not follow that rule and attended a party with more than 50 people during the shore excursion.\u00a0 You indicated that on the ship\u2019s form, and as a result, you were not allowed to reboard the ship.\u00a0 This boarding denial would not qualify for coverage under the denied boarding covered reason because you did not follow the travel supplier\u2019s rules and requirements to travel, an express condition of the denied boarding covered reason.
