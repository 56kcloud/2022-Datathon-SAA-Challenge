## Help insurers make your travels fun again!
Are you planning your next vacation yet? Due to the Covid pandemic, people are
more interested in travel insurance. But how can they find what the coverage
includes? Your task is to improve the customer experience of finding the needed
information. As well as, to enhance the ability of insurers to deliver the right
answers to their customers. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to solve
this business problem. This challenge from the Swiss Association of Actuaries
(SAA) provides a Q&A Bot template. That uses the latest Amazon Web Services
(AWS) tools and a real-world FAQ dataset. Do you want to help make insurance
more transparent? Do you want to have more convenient travel planning? Then sign
