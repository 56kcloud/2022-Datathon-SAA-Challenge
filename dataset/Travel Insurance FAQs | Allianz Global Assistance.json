      "Question": "Why do I need travel\u00a0protection?",
      "Answer": "Travel is inherently risky, and so insurance can safeguard you from certain financial losses that often occur while traveling. If you have to cancel your beach rental for a covered reason, for example, trip cancellation/interruption benefits can reimburse you for your non-refundable, pre-paid trip costs (up to the amount of your plan limits). If your snowboarding gear gets stolen during your winter vacation, baggage loss/damage benefits can reimburse you for the loss. Depending on the plan you choose, travel insurance also can reimburse eligible medical costs in case of a covered medical or dental emergency; reimburse you for losses caused by a covered travel delay or baggage delay; protect you from paying for rental car damage or loss; and help in other situations as well.

      "Question": "Why do I need rental car insurance?",
      "Answer": "When you\u2019re renting a car, even a tiny fender-bender can get really expensive. You may have to pay the deductible on your own collision insurance, as well as a loss of use charge from the rental car company \u2014 not to mention the higher insurance rates following an at-fault accident. The OneTrip Rental Car Protector\u00a0can cover costs up to $75,000 if a car you're renting is stolen or is damaged in a covered accident or while it's left unattended. There\u2019s no deductible and no need to file a claim with your car insurance company. You also get trip interruption benefits and baggage loss/damage benefits up to $1,000. (The\u00a0OneTrip Rental Car Protector\u00a0does not include liability insurance. Terms, conditions, and exclusions apply. Please see your plan for full details. Benefits/coverage may vary by state, and sublimits may apply.)"
    },
    {
      "Question": "What is included\u00a0in non-refundable trip costs?",
      "Answer": "Non-refundable costs include pre-paid trip deposits/payments that would be lost if you had to cancel for a covered reason prior to trip departure. Some examples may include vacation rental costs, campground fees; rental car fees; tickets for tours or events; and hotel and airline ticket costs. Be sure to consult your travel suppliers to determine which costs are non-refundable for your particular trip, as cancellation policies vary."

    {
      "Question": "What do travel protection plans cover?",

    {
      "Question": "How do I know which travel protection plan to buy?",
      "Answer": "That depends on your budget, your destination and your specific situation. If your biggest worry is protecting your vacation investment in case of a last-minute cancellation or trip interruption, then you need a plan with trip cancellation/interruption benefits. If you\u2019re more concerned about mishaps that occur while traveling \u2014 such as baggage loss or delay, or trip delays \u2014 look for a plan with post-departure benefits. And to protect yourself in case of a medical emergency while traveling, we recommend a plan that includes emergency medical and emergency medical transportation benefits.

      "Question": "Who is covered by my travel protection plan?",
      "Answer": "Your travel insurance plan covers only people who are named insured \u2014 that is, named in the plan. Family members and/or travel companions are not covered unless they\u2019re named in your plan documents.

      "Question": "Do travel protection plans cover pets?",
      "Answer": "Your travel insurance benefits do not cover pets. However, we include service animals (as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act) in our definition of \u201cfamily members,\u201d so any benefits that apply to family members would also apply to service animals. Emotional support animals or therapy animals are not considered service animals by the ADA."

    {
      "Question": "Do travel protection plans cover pregnancy?",
      "Answer": "Travel insurance from Allianz Global Assistance does not cover losses resulting from normal pregnancy or childbirth, except as expressly covered under Trip Cancellation Coverage. Specifically, if you find out that you are pregnant after purchasing your travel insurance plan, that can be considered a covered reason for trip cancellation. While normal pregnancy and childbirth are not covered, unforeseen pregnancy complications may be a covered reason for trip cancellation or interruption. The medical condition you\u2019re experiencing must be disabling enough to make a reasonable person cancel their trip, and a doctor must advise you to cancel it. If your plan includes emergency medical benefits, your insurance may reimburse you for the cost of emergency medical care that you received for those covered complications while traveling.

    {
      "Question": "Does my health insurance cover me overseas?",
      "Answer": "Before traveling overseas, it\u2019s wise to ask your health insurance provider if your coverage travels with you. Medicare generally does not offer coverage overseas, and hospitals in other countries often require cash payments up front. Also, very few health insurance companies pay for your medical evacuation back to the United States, as the U.S. Department of State explains. This is why it\u2019s so important to have travel insurance with emergency medical and emergency medical transportation benefits. Read more: Do I Need Travel Insurance If I Have Health Insurance?"

      "Question": "If I cancel my trip, do I get my money back?",

If a hurricane floods your beach house; if a family member falls ill right before your vacation; or if you fracture your ankle right before your golf getaway, those all can be covered reasons for canceling your trip and getting reimbursed. Other examples of covered reasons may include: sudden covered medical emergencies; the birth of a family member\u2019s child; the death of a travel companion or family member; financial default of a covered airline, cruise line or tour operator; legal separation or divorce; or jury duty. Some reasons for cancellation\u00a0aren't\u00a0covered, such as changing your mind about taking a trip or other things not named in your Certificate of Insurance/Policy. If you cancel your trip for a covered reason, you must notify your travel supplier(s) within 72 hours of the cancellation.

    {
      "Question": "If I have a pre-existing medical condition can I still purchase travel protection?",
      "Answer": "Yes. If your plan includes the Pre-Existing Medical Condition Exclusion Waiver, you may be covered for losses due to a pre-existing medical condition if you meet all the following requirements:  Your plan was purchased within 14 days of the date of the first trip payment or deposit; You were a U.S. resident when the plan was purchased; You were medically able to travel when the plan was purchased; and On the plan purchase date, you insured the full non-refundable cost of your trip with us.

If you incur additional non-refundable trip expenses after you purchase your plan, you must insure them with us within 14 days of their purchase. If you do not, those expenses will still be subject to the pre-existing medical condition exclusion. Coverage limits may vary based upon your chosen plan. Please see your Certificate of Insurance/Policy for terms, conditions, and exclusions. Even if you don't purchase protection that covers existing medical conditions, or if you don't meet the requirements for that coverage, you can still purchase travel protection; just be aware that any loss due to an existing medical condition will be excluded."
    },
    {
      "Question": "What is supplier default?",

This means a covered supplier \u2014 such as a tour operator, airline, or cruise line \u2014 ceases all operations due to its financial condition, with or without filing for bankruptcy. Coverage applies to non-refundable payments and deposits you made before your trip was canceled, less any published refunds you're entitled to receive."
