             Travel is inherently risky, and so insurance can safeguard you from certain financial losses that often occur while traveling. If you have to cancel your beach rental for a covered reason, for example, trip cancellation/interruption benefits can reimburse you for your non-refundable, pre-paid trip costs (up to the amount of your plan limits). If your snowboarding gear gets stolen during your winter vacation, baggage loss/damage benefits can reimburse you for the loss. Depending on the plan you choose, travel insurance also can reimburse eligible medical costs in case of a covered medical or dental emergency; reimburse you for losses caused by a covered travel delay or baggage delay; protect you from paying for rental car damage or loss; and help in other situations as well.

             When you’re renting a car, even a tiny fender-bender can get really expensive. You may have to pay the deductible on your own collision insurance, as well as a loss of use charge from the rental car company — not to mention the higher insurance rates following an at-fault accident. The

              OneTrip Rental Car Protector

             can cover costs up to $75,000 if a car you're renting is stolen or is damaged in a covered accident or while it's left unattended. There’s no deductible and no need to file a claim with your car insurance company. You also get trip interruption benefits and baggage loss/damage benefits up to $1,000.

             Non-refundable costs include pre-paid trip deposits/payments that would be lost if you had to cancel for a covered reason prior to trip departure. Some examples may include vacation rental costs, campground fees; rental car fees; tickets for tours or events; and hotel and airline ticket costs. Be sure to consult your travel suppliers to determine which costs are non-refundable for your particular trip, as cancellation policies vary.

             That depends on your budget, your destination and your specific situation. If your biggest worry is protecting your vacation investment in case of a last-minute cancellation or trip interruption, then you need a plan with trip cancellation/interruption benefits. If you’re more concerned about mishaps that occur while traveling — such as baggage loss or delay, or trip delays — look for a plan with post-departure benefits. And to protect yourself in case of a medical emergency while traveling, we recommend a plan that includes emergency medical and emergency medical transportation benefits.

             Travel insurance from Allianz Global Assistance does not cover losses resulting from normal pregnancy or childbirth, except as expressly covered under Trip Cancellation Coverage. Specifically, if you find out that you are pregnant after purchasing your travel insurance plan, that can be considered a covered reason for trip cancellation.
            </p>
            <p>
             While normal pregnancy and childbirth are not covered, unforeseen pregnancy complications may be a covered reason for trip cancellation or interruption. The medical condition you’re experiencing must be disabling enough to make a reasonable person cancel their trip, and a doctor must advise you to cancel it. If your plan includes emergency medical benefits, your insurance may reimburse you for the cost of emergency medical care that you received for those covered complications while traveling.

             Before traveling overseas, it’s wise to ask your health insurance provider if your coverage travels with you. Medicare generally does not offer coverage overseas, and hospitals in other countries often require cash payments up front. Also, very few health insurance companies pay for your medical evacuation back to the United States,

            <p>
             Trip cancellation benefits can reimburse your prepaid, nonrefundable trip payments if you have to cancel your trip for one of the covered reasons stated in your plan documents. If a hurricane floods your beach house; if a family member falls ill right before your vacation; or if you fracture your ankle right before your golf getaway, those all can be covered reasons for canceling your trip and getting reimbursed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Other examples of covered reasons may include: sudden covered medical emergencies; the birth of a family member’s child; the death of a travel companion or family member; financial default of a covered airline, cruise line or tour operator; legal separation or divorce; or jury duty. Some reasons for cancellation
             <strong>
              aren't

             covered, such as changing your mind about taking a trip or other things not named in your Certificate of Insurance/Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you cancel your trip for a covered reason, you must notify your travel supplier(s) within 72 hours of the cancellation. Not all plans include trip cancellation benefits. Please see the Certificate of Insurance/Policy for terms, conditions, and exclusions.

             The cost of travel insurance generally depends on a few key factors: the age of the traveler(s), the cost of the trip, and the level of coverage desired. The cost is

              not
             </strong>
             affected by your destination or your prior medical or claims history. There is a per diem cost for trips over 30 days in length.

            <p>
             The timeline for receiving payment for a claim depends on two things: the time required to process your claim (see above) and the payment method you choose. We recommend choosing debit disbursement (sending money to your debit card electronically) or direct deposit (sending money to your bank account electronically) as your payment option, if your claim is eligible.
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              If you're filing online, select debit or direct deposit on the payment info page.
             </li>
             <li>
              On the phone, ask Customer Service to select debit or direct deposit for your reimbursement.
             </li>
             <li>
              If you're submitting a claim via email, mail or fax, mark debit or direct deposit on the claim form.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             If your claim is eligible for payment, debit disbursements may be received immediately, the next day, or within two to five business days, depending on your bank's processing times. Direct deposit takes two to five business days, based upon bank processing times.
            </p>
            <p>
             We can also mail you a check if you'd prefer, but please note that it can take 10 to 14 days to receive it.

             Yes. If your plan includes the Pre-Existing Medical Condition Exclusion Waiver, you may be covered for losses due to a pre-existing medical condition

              Your plan was purchased within 14 days of the date of the first trip payment or deposit;
             </li>
             <li>
              You were a U.S. resident when the plan was purchased;

              You were medically able to travel when the plan was purchased; and
             </li>
             <li>
              On the plan purchase date, you insured the full non-refundable cost of your trip with us. This includes trip arrangements that will become non-refundable or subject to cancellation penalties between the plan purchase date and the departure date.
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             If you incur additional non-refundable trip expenses after you purchase your plan, you must insure them with us within 14 days of their purchase. If you do not, those expenses will still be subject to the pre-existing medical condition exclusion. Coverage limits may vary based upon your chosen plan. Please see your Certificate of Insurance/Policy for terms, conditions, and exclusions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even if you don't purchase protection that covers existing medical conditions, or if you don't meet the requirements for that coverage, you can still purchase travel protection; just be aware that any loss due to an existing medical condition will be excluded.

             Some travel protection plans include supplier financial default as a covered reason for trip cancellation and trip interruption. This means a covered supplier — such as a tour operator, airline, or cruise line — ceases all operations due to its financial condition, with or without filing for bankruptcy. Coverage applies to non-refundable payments and deposits you made before your trip was canceled, less any published refunds you're entitled to receive.

If you have to cancel your beach rental for a covered reason, for example, trip cancellation/interruption benefits can reimburse you for your non-refundable, pre-paid trip costs (up to the amount of your plan limits). If your snowboarding gear gets stolen during your winter vacation, baggage loss/damage benefits can reimburse you for the loss. Depending on the plan you choose, travel insurance also can reimburse eligible medical costs in case of a covered medical or dental emergency; reimburse you for losses caused by a covered travel delay or baggage delay; protect you from paying for rental car damage or loss; and help in other situations as well." } }, { "@type": "Question", "name": "Why do I need rental car insurance?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "When you’re renting a car, even a tiny fender-bender can get really expensive. You may have to pay the deductible on your own collision insurance, as well as a loss of use charge from the rental car company — not to mention the higher insurance rates following an at-fault accident. The Rental Car Damage Protector can cover costs up to $40,000 if a car you're renting is stolen or is damaged in a covered accident or while it's left unattended. There’s no deductible and no need to file a claim with your car insurance company. You also get trip interruption benefits and baggage loss/damage benefits up to $1,000. (The Rental Car Damage Protector does not include liability insurance. Terms, conditions, and exclusions apply. Please see your plan for full details. Benefits/coverage may vary by state, and sublimits may apply.)" } }, { "@type": "Question", "name": "What is included in non-refundable trips cost?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Non-refundable costs include pre-paid trip deposits/payments that would be lost if you had to cancel for a covered reason prior to trip departure. Some examples may include vacation rental costs, campground fees; rental car fees; tickets for tours or events; and hotel and airline ticket costs. Be sure to consult your travel suppliers to determine which costs are non-refundable for your particular trip, as cancellation policies vary." } }, { "@type": "Question", "name": "What do travel protection plans cover?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Depending on the plan you choose, travel insurance can provide benefits for a number of situations that may occur before or during your trip. These benefits may include: Trip Cancellation, Trip Interruption, Emergency Medical Transportation, Emergency Medical/Dental, Lost/Stolen/Delayed Baggage, Travel Delay, Change Fee Coverage, Loyalty Program Redeposit Fee Coverage, Rental Car Damage Protection, 24-Hour Hotline Assistance. Note: Not all plans include each benefit listed here. Please see the Certificate of Insurance/Policy for terms, conditions, and exclusions." } }, { "@type": "Question", "name": "How do I know which travel protection plan to buy?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text":"That depends on your budget, your destination and your specific situation. If your biggest worry is protecting your vacation investment in case of a last-minute cancellation or trip interruption, then you need a plan with trip cancellation/interruption benefits. If you’re more concerned about mishaps that occur while traveling — such as baggage loss or delay, or trip delays — look for a plan with post-departure benefits. And to protect yourself in case of a medical emergency while traveling, we recommend a plan that includes emergency medical and emergency medical transportation benefits." } }, { "@type": "Question", "name": "Who is covered by my travel protection plan?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Your travel insurance plan covers only people who are named insured — that is, named in the plan.

If you purchase the OneTrip Prime or OneTrip Premier plan, kids 17 and under are covered free when traveling with a parent or grandparent. The AllTrips Premier plan also can cover an entire household on a single plan." } }, { "@type": "Question", "name": "Do travel protection plans cover pets?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Your travel insurance benefits do not cover pets. However, we include service animals (as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act) in our definition of “family members,” so any benefits that apply to family members would also apply to service animals.

Specifically, if you find out that you are pregnant after purchasing your travel insurance plan, that can be considered a covered reason for trip cancellation. <p>While normal pregnancy and childbirth are not covered, unforeseen pregnancy complications may be a covered reason for trip cancellation or interruption. The medical condition you’re experiencing must be disabling enough to make a reasonable person cancel their trip, and a doctor must advise you to cancel it. If your plan includes emergency medical benefits, your insurance may reimburse you for the cost of emergency medical care that you received for those covered complications while traveling.</p>" } }, { "@type": "Question", "name": "Does my health insurance cover me overseas?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Before traveling overseas, it’s wise to ask your health insurance provider if your coverage travels with you. Medicare generally does not offer coverage overseas, and hospitals in other countries often require cash payments up front. Also, very few health insurance companies pay for your medical evacuation back to the United States, as the U.S. Department of State explains. This is why it’s so important to have travel insurance with emergency medical and emergency medical transportation benefits." } }, { "@type": "Question", "name": "What can 24-Hour Hotline Assistance do for me?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "You can call 24-Hour Hotline Assistance anytime to reach a team of multilingual specialists who can help you with many types of travel problems, from reporting lost baggage to finding emergency medical providers. Our Hotline Assistance team has helped road-trippers locate a lost wallet and RVers find emergency boarding for their dog, among other feats. They can also help you replace passports and essential travel documents, refer you to legal assistance, secure cash from home in case of emergency, and may be able to guarantee payment when you need to be admitted to a hospital, if you have a covered medical emergency while traveling." } }, { "@type": "Question", "name": "Am I able to change my flight through Allianz Global Assistance?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "We can’t change your travel arrangements for you.
