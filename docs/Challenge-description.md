# The Challenge
## Summary
Build a Q&A Bot for travel insurance related questions in Covid-19 times and
make customers happy and insurance companies more resilient.

## The Problem
Most of us have a travel insurance in some form, be it a policy with a
traditional insurer, coverage from your credit card or individual trip
insurance. Especially in Covid-19 times travel insurance could become extra
valuable. However, in specific situations it’s often unclear what is covered and
what isn’t. We want to get our specific questions answered conveniently and
don’t want to work through the policy terms and conditions. Calling or writing
an insurance company often ends up in significant waiting times. Especially in
times where help centers are particularly busy. A Q&A Bot is the right answer
because it gives customers instant answers and at the same time saves resources
of insurance help centers.

## Your Impact

* build a Q&A Bot which answers questions about travel insurance coverage
