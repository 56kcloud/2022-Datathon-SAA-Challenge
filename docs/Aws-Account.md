# AWS Account
To work on the challenge each team needs to have **one** AWS Account.

## Create an AWS Account
You can sign up for a new AWS account
[here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

## Create IAM Users
With the email address, you get access to the root user of the account. This
user has the highest privileges in the account, and should only be used for
management tasks. For all of the daily tasks and especially for this challenge
IAM Users should be used (if not specified otherwise).

To create IAM users go to the [Identity and Access Management
(IAM)](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2) service. On the users
page, you can create new IAM user. You need to create one user for each of your
teammates and also one user for you.

1. Set user details
   * User name
   * For **Select AWS credential type** select both
     * ✅ Access key - Programmatic access

       Used to access the AWS APIs
     * ✅ Password - AWS Management Console access

       Used to login to the AWS Web UI, also called Management Console or AWS Console
     * **Console password:** Autogenerated password
     * **Require password reset:** ✅ User must create a new password at next
       sign-in
1. Set permissions
   * Select **Attach existing policies directly**
   * ✅ **AdministratorAccess**. This gives all of you and your teammates access
     to all the services.

For this challenge, you don't need to create any tags. After double checking
that all the information is correct, you can then proceed to create the user and
distributed the credentials to your teammate.

## Redeem Credits
For the challenge, AWS sponsored credits for each of the teams. You receive the code from the SAA team onsite.

**NOTE:** This task needs to be executed as the root user of the AWS Account.

After you created the account, you can redeem the in the [Billing Service ->
