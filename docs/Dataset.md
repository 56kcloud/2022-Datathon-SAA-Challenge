# Dataset
This challenges provides with you real-world travel insurance datasets related
to COVID-19. These datasets are from the [Allianz Partners
Group](https://www.allianz-partners.com).

You can find all the datasets in the [dataset folder](./../dataset/) in the root
directory of this repository.

You will find two different sources for the datasets. One is the [Allianz Travel
Switzerland](https://www.allianz-travel.ch/en_CH/services/faq.html) FAQ and the
other the Allianz Global Assistance FAQ. For both of these, you
find two versions:
* A Amazon Kendra compatible JSON
* The raw HTML page

Both sources provide an english version of the FAQ. In addition, the Swiss site
provides you with multiple languages and you find also the german version in the
dataset folder.

Besides the FAQ data, you can use the following link, to download the [General
Terms and
Conditions](https://www.allianz-travel.ch/en_CH/services/download-center.html).
With these you should be able to further enhance the capabilities of your bot.

As a backup solution, you can find the downloaded Terms and Conditions also in the dataset folder [here](./../dataset/terms-and-conditions/).
